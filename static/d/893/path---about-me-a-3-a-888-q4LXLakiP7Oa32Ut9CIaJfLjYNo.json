I began my journey in tech by working as a native Android developer. During this period of time, I worked for a couple of startups, where I learned how to work in a fast-moving work environment.</p>\n<p>I became a goal-oriented person, with a great passion for what I do. Later I decided I wanted to expand my knowledge in other fields, so I started learning web development with Javascript. As a consequence, I got to participate in web projects and gain a good amount of experience.</p>\n<p>Currently I’m still learning and hoping I can make enough time to get into AI / Machine Learning. Sometimes I also write on my blog about things that I care about. I also enjoy music, playing drums and guitar (or at least I try), and suck at 99% of sports.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about-me/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/js-vs-java-part-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"JS vs Java: Part 2 — Object creation, inheritance, encapsulation, and modules"}},"next":null}}
