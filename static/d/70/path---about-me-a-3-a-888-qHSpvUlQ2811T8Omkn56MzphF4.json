I then decided I wanted to expand my knowledge in other fields, so I started learning web development with Javascript. As a consequence, I got to participate in web and mobile/web projects and gain more experience.</p>\n<p>As of today, I’m still constantly learning and hoping I can make enough time to get into AI / Machine Learning.
