This application consists in an e-commerce scraper (it crawls across multiple websites in parallel). The back end is a Node.js app, and the front end is React.js/Redux.
You can read more about it in the repo itself. It includes:
- Front end (creating components, redux stores, thunks, websockets, basic UI with material-UI, basic navigation)
- Back end (Node.js app, REST endpoints)
- Scrapers (JS based with X-Ray)
- Basic unit tests in both ends with Jest and Mocha
- CI/CD flow with CircleCI and Docker
